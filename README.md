# Gameplay

This is a highscore challenge game. Only work for 9:16 aspect ratio because I didn't make ajdustments for different aspect ratios.
* Every collision with side walls worth 1 point. 
* If you touch spikes you lose. 
* Every 5 points spike count increases up to 5 at most.
* After reaching max difficuty, ball starts to speed up.
* There are two bonuses D and S.
* D decreases difficulty.
* S decreases balls speed.
